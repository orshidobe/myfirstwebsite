        <h2>Mark Rothko</h2>
        <p>
          Mark Rothko, was an American painter of Russian Jewish descent.
          Although Rothko himself refused to adhere to any art movement,
          he is generally identified as an abstract expressionist.By the late
          1940s, Rothko had shifted into nonobjective abstraction, creating
          masses of pure color instead of figures in space.
          Rothko created the Rothko Chapel, a non-denominational chapel
          filled with many of his paintings.
